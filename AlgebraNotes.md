# Algebra Qs

## Formulas

Given the following formulas:

y = 5x + 100
if x=5,then y= ?? (125)

y = 3x - 2
if x=2,then y= ?? (4)

y = 7x - 20
if x=3,then y= ?? (1)

y = 42 - 3x
if x=3,then y= ?? (33)

y = 4x - x + 3
if x=4,then y= ?? (15)


f(x) = 2x + (x * x) - 5
f(5) = ?? (30)

f(x,y)= x^2 + y
If x = 2 and y = 5, then f(x,y) = ?? (9)

f(x,y)= x^2 + y + 35
If x = 8 and y = 17, then f(x,y) = ?? (116)

### Triangles

The area of a triangle is Area = (h*b)/2
If h = 4 and b = 5, then Area = ?? (10)
If a triangle's Area = 20 and b = 10, then h = ? (4)

### Velocity 

If a car is moving at an initial velocity V, 
and accelerates at rate of A for a set time period of T, 
the formula to determine it final velocity S is:

S = V + A*T

If V is 20 meters per second, and A is 10 meters per second squared, it will it take T = ?? seconds to reach an S of 150 meters per second. (13)

### Compound Interest

The following is a formula representing compounded interest over time:
A = P * (1 + r/n)^nt
In this equation, 
- A represents the total balance amount, 
- P represents the principal ($$), 
- r represents the interest rate, 
- n represents the number of times interest is compounded each year, 
- t represents the elapsed time, in years.

With a rate of r = 0.10 that compounds _each month_ and a principal of P = 1,000, in 7 years, the total balance amount will be ?? ($2007.92)
